# Mayday, Mayday!
Simple monitoring and alerting system written in Ruby.

## Why I decided to implement yet another monitoring system?
I have been working with monitoring systems for the last couple of months. During this time I had to evaluate a couple of monitoring tools/systems and understand very good what are the business requirements for such a thing. The conclusions to which I came are:
* Implementing a monitoring system is hard.
* They must be maintainable.
* They should produce meaningfull and actionable alarms.

The software of choice for the monitoring system on which I worked was [Riemann](http://riemann.io/). Nice and quick tool written in Clojure, which can be integrated with basically most of popular pieces of software out there. Aftet I worked it for some time I identified the following:

**pros**
* [quick](http://blog.robotninjas.org/2013/03/11/load-testing-riemann/)
* push - I pefer this over pull as if the server doesn't know anything about the targets of monitoring, makes the maintainence much simpler.
* flexible - almost everything can be inplemented with it (its configuration file is pure Clojure file).
* easy to integrate with a lot of databases and messaging services

**cons**
* aggregation
* [index](http://riemann.io/concepts.html) is not persisted
* clustering is not possible - [Riemann](http://riemann.io/) performs arbitrary computation over the event stream, with side effects and it cannot be distributed safely.
* flexible - lack of framework. If you need a scallable configuration you will have to implement one by yourself. If you do not take this in mind big configuration can get messy.
* no naming conventions for the services - There are really no rules for naming services. 
* event states are often not final - There are a lot of [Riemann](http://riemann.io/) clients which define event states which are often not those which we need. Because of this those events have to be processed additionally and those states to be changed.
* alerting logic spread between Riemann and clients - I think that in order to be maintainable it should be on one place and this place should be located after the data is persisted.

The database of choice which I was using with [Riemann](http://riemann.io/) was [InfluxDB](https://influxdb.com/) - quite young series database.
